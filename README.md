My small tutorial of making a tic tac toe game

This was really simple, I selected my cells that I wanted for my grid

I also made sure to modify my borders as well by going into the border settings.

Finally, by using the above formula, I have created the tic tac toe scoring and functioning method. This works because this formula checks if the top horizontal row of the tic tac toe board is filled with "X"s, and if it is, the formula displays "X wins". If the top row does not contain 3 X's, then the cell containing the formula will be blank.
